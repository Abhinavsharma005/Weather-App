ðŸŒ¦ Weather-App

Whether you're planning your next trip or just curious about the weather, this app delivers real-time updates with a clean and interactive UI. One of my favorite features? The dynamic background that changes with the weather â€” makes the experience way more engaging! ðŸŒ¤ðŸŒ§ðŸŒ™

ðŸ’¡ Here's the tech I worked with:

âœ… Kotlin + XML for native Android development

âœ… OpenWeather API for live weather data

âœ… Android Studio for building and testing the app

âœ… Custom UI that displays details like sunrise, sunset, humidity, wind speed, and more
